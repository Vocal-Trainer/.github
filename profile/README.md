# Vocal 

Many amateur singers struggle to improve their pitch and timing without feedback from a vocal coach. To address this, a mobile app is being developed that measures users' singing capabilities and aids them in progressively increasing their skills. The app provides an interactive time-pitch graph that shows users how their input compares to the original isolated vocal song. By analyzing users' singing, the system provides real-time feedback. This voice training software tool allows amateur singers to improve their skills conveniently and affordably. Although this app is designed primarily for amateur singers looking to enhance their singing abilities, it can also be used by professional singers who want to practice and improve their skills. Additionally, the app is integrated with TikTok, allowing users to share their progress and connect with other amateur singers.
